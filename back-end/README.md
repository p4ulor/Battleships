## Open this folder using IntelliJ
The `.run` folder contains the "Run/Debug" configurations that I saved as being part of the project. It's interpreted 
by IntelliJ. It comes with 3 configs: run a One config runs the server using the memory as the DB, the other uses Posgresql as the DB.
# Contents
- **.run** -> Some run configurations (for IntelliJ)
- **gradle/wrapper** -> Info about gradle version to be used during build
- **src/main** 
    - **kotlin/** -> source code
    - **resources/** -> static content (HTML, JavaScript & media sent to client's browser)
    - **sql-scripts** -> The PostgreSQL scripts
- **staticdev** -> A folder that is useful to use when testing solely the front-end build. Which will null out the necessity of re-building & running the server to apply the front-end code changes (by copying them to here), unlike putting it on `src/main/resources`. In order for this to work, make sure the file [resources/application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties) property 
set at `spring.web.resources.static-locations`
to references this folder first.
- **build.gradle.kts** -> Plugins and dependencies in use
- **gradle.bat** for Windows and `gradlew` for Linux (or Mac)
## Docker files:
- **docker-compose.yml** -> Defines list of containers to run locally
- **docker-compose-azure** -> Specific docker-compose file to run containers in Azure
- **Dockerfile_azure** -> Specific docker file to run the container in Azure
- **DockerfileMem** -> Docker file to run the server in memory
- **DockerfilePostgres** -> Docker file to run the server in postgres

# How to deploy
## 1 - In front-end folder, build the project
- npm run prod

Copy the resulting files in `dist/` to `src/main/resources/public` in the back-end. 
Make sure `spring.web.resources.static-locations=` is properly set in the file `application.properties`
## 2 - Build jar (final artifact w/ dependencies)
- gradle bootJar

For curiosity sake, you can make sure the front-end files are in the artifact `back-end/build/libs/battleship-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`. 
Open the .jar with Winrar or 7-zip and check the files are in `/BOOT-INF/classes/static`.
Don't try to build the artifact using IntelliJ, the manifest and the .jar structure will not work out. Work with the framework (spring) [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43520616/artifact-of-spring-boot-project-generated-by-intellij-idea-causes-errors#:~:text=You%20are%20using%20Spring%20Boot%20and%20as%20such%20should%20also%20use%20the%20Spring%20Boot%20Maven%20Plugin%20to%20create%20an%20executable%20artifact.%20You%20are%20working%20around%20the%20framework%20instead%20of%20with%20the%20framework)

## 3 a) - Run everything with [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
In this step you can use docker desktop which has a great interface and is easy to use. Or just start the service with `sudo systemctl start docker`
- Wait until the Docker Engine is running (green light)

- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -p "battleship-servers" up`

The -f indicates that the container will run in the foreground (in docker compose),
meaning that if you close the terminal, the container will shutdown. 

After you build, the images list in docker won't update, you'll need to restart docker desktop. The process of the container starts and attaches to the console to the processâ€™s standard input, standard output, and standard error

-d would indicate to run in the background (detached mode)

-p indicates the name of the group of containers. By default it will be the name of the folder the docker-compose.yml file is in

Docker compose will run multiple containers in 1 containers named Battleship-servers

#### To only build the images and not start containers:
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build`
- `up` -> Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service
- `down` -> Stops containers and removes containers, networks, volumes, and images created by up
- Note: docker-compose only allows putting the `-f` in the beginning and `build` at the end apparently
## 3 b) - Run 1 container at a time
Build image (see images page in docker desktop). The -f indicates filename, the -t indicates the name of the image
- `docker build -f DockerfileMem . -t battleship-image`

Run container (see containers page in docker desktop, open (click) the container, and see the prints, and check the port)
- `docker run -d -p 8080:9000 battleship-image`

Now acess http://localhost:8080/ 

Note: Having `--server.port=8082` as part of the CMD args in the Dockerfile will make adding docker env variables like `--env SERVER_PORT=8083`
to not take effect, because it will not override (cmd args has more priority, and it will be set on the image)
To properly override the server.port variable, put `--env SERVER_PORT=8082` before `battleship-image`.
The 8080 is the port you use to access the server.

#### Meaning of the -p command (if I undertood it correcly):
Port that the host enviornment will use to connect to the container. 
- [External Port] **:** [Internal Container's port (which I think is shared among all containers of a container group)]

See [1](https://runnable.com/docker/binding-docker-ports), [2](8https://www.baeldung.com/linux/assign-port-docker-container#why-we-use-port-mapping), [3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25350496/running-docker-container-on-a-specific-port), [4](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#publish-or-expose-port--p---expose)

## Run another container
- docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --env SERVER_PORT=8081 battleship-image

## Notes:
When some changes aren't making effect, execute gradle's task `clean` and delete the images and try again. When you run the docker compose it uses the latest
built images, thus you need to delete them so they are built again using the latest jar. Try to delete `docker_pg_database` docker volumes folder

The param `&auth-method=password` is in the `JDBC_DATABASE_URL` because if I didn't it would give the error: 
`org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "172.21.0.3", user "postgres", database "postgres", no encryption`. [Stack overflow reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25641047/org-postgresql-util-psqlexception-fatal-no-pg-hba-conf-entry-for-host). See [auth-method postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/auth-pg-hba-conf.html#:~:text=and%20hostnossl%20records.-,auth%2Dmethod,-Specifies%20the%20authentication)
